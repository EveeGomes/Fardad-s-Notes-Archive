  Binary operators:
  A @ B       operator@

  no side effect
  A + B       operator+

  with side effect
  A += B      operator+=

  int a[5], b[6];

  a + b  this overload is not possible becaue (int*) + (int*) is defined already
  Unary operators:
  @A     operator@


  B++    operator++(int)
  B--    operator--(int)


  Object A;
  prem   b;

  A @ b  1- A has a method called 
            operator@ that receives 
            b as an argument
         2- operator@ is a standalone 
            function accepting two args; 
            A and b

  Object A;
  Object B;
  AnyType X;

  Object A code is not accessible (library classes, classes written by other, etc...)
  
  X = A @ B;
  
  X = operator@(A, B);   
  
  signature: 
  AnyType? operator(const? Object? A, const? Object? B)
