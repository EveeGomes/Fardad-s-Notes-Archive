Quiz 4:
Create an Employee class.
-       An Employee has a name that is maximum of 20 characters.
-       An Employee had an employee number that is a 6 digit integer.
-       When an employee is created with no argument it is set to a safe empty state, with -1 as employee number and a blank name.
-       An Employee can be created with two arguments: char string for name and an integer for an employee number.
-       An Employee can display itself as follows:
Name, EmpNo: 999999
or
Invalid Employee (if it is in safe empty state).
class Employee{
   char name_[21];
   int empno_;
   public:
   Employee(){
      empno_ = -1;
      name_[0] = NULL:
   }
   Empolyee(const char name[], int empno){
      strcpy(name_, name);
      empno_ = empno;
   }
   void display(){
      if(name[0]){
         cout << name_ <<", EmpNo: "<< empno_ << endl;
      }
      else{
         cout << "Invalid Employee" << endl;
      }
   }
};
